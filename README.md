# What's YouTube Vanced?

Vanced is an improved version of YouTube without ads, SponsorBlock for automatically skipping any sponsered garbage as well as the return of dislikes!

microG is necessary for it to work online and could be considered as an "alternative Google Play Services"

This does NOT require a rooted device

I created this repository due to the recent removal of all the Vanced apps from their official website.
I cloned the existing .APK's from my other phone so I could easily install it on my other phone as well.
Now this repository contains all the Vanced apps, so it's more convenient to link to those who've requested it on Reddit, instead of 4 separate Google Drive links.

# Contents:
1. Vanced Manager
2. Vanced microG
3. YouTube Vanced
4. Download link to YouTube Music Vanced (due to being unable to upload files over 25MB to GitHub)
YouTube Music Vanced can instead be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/104quHy7OKE95NbkGJebUk3O_yCibWpr1/view

If anyone does ever decide to use this: enjoy!
